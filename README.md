# GraphMatching
A graph matching library which provides stable and popular matching algorithms for the HR problem.


## Dependencies:
clang compiler, cmake, ninja (if desired)


## Installation
    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake -G "Ninja" ../
    $ ninja

You can replace Ninja with "Unix Makefiles" in the above command.
Then type make to build.

This should build an executable named graphmatching inside the build directory.


## Usage
The executable takes a set of parameters to compute the desired matching:

	-s -- compute a stable matching
	-p -- compute a maximum cardinality popular matching
	-m -- compute a maximum cardinality matching
	-h -- compute a matching in a given HRLQ instance
	-t -- compute a stable matching for single side tied(women) instances using reduction

To provide an input graph, and the output matching filename:

	-i -- /path/to/graphfile
	-o -- /path/to/store/the/matching

Also, for the -s, -p, and -m parameters, you could specify the resident/hospital
proposing algorithm (by default it runs the resident proposing algorithm).

	-A -- run the resident proposing algorithm
	-B -- run the hospital proposing algorithm

For e.g., to compute a stable matching with the hospitals proposing (assuming inside the build directory):

	$ ./graphmatching -B -s -i ../tests/hrlq_m6.txt -o ../tests/hrlq_m6_stable.txt
